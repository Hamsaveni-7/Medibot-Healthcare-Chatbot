MEDIBOT

MEDIBOT is a disease prediction model designed to predict diseases based on patient data.

Project Overview
MEDIBOT uses machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on patient data. The model is trained on a dataset of patient information and can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease.

Features
- Disease prediction: MEDIBOT can predict diseases based on patient data, including symptoms, medical history, and demographic information.
- Machine learning: MEDIBOT uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and make predictions.

Installation
To install the MEDIBOT project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/Hamsaveni-7/MEDIBOT.git.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the model using python app.py.

Usage
To use the MEDIBOT project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your patient data in the required format.
2. Run the model using python app.py.
3. The model will output the predicted disease likelihood.

Project Structure
The MEDIBOT project is structured as follows:

- app.py: The main application file for the MEDIBOT project.
